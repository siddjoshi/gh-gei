- Added `gei finalize-repo` command to finalize completed migrations. Supports archiving the source repository (read-only), and migrating repository artifacts not included in the default migration: settings, autolinks, topics, and branch protection rules. Currently supports GHES as a source. Includes `--dry-run` and `--skip-artifacts` options.
- Fixed `ado2gh generate-script --download-migration-logs` to generate valid commands using `--target-api-url` that work with the `ado2gh download-logs` command
- Added `--target-api-url` support to `ado2gh download-logs` and `bbs2gh download-logs` commands for GHEC data residency scenarios
- Maintained backward compatibility: `--github-api-url` continues to work as an alias for `--target-api-url` in `ado2gh` and `bbs2gh` CLIs
